# crunchbase_hunterio_api

Fill in crunchbase api_key and hunterio api_key to use.
The code of crunchbase part is only for Open Data Map. 

I was planning to add database operations in the hunterio_db.py (read companies_XXXXXXX.csv & read emails_searched_by_domain.csv and get the complement set), but I'm running out of requests at Hunter.io, so... I probably will fix this when I can get more requests.
